# Traffic-Light-Controller-PLC
This project implements a traffic light control system for a four-way intersection using a PLC. The system follows a set sequence where Traffic Light 1 and Traffic Light 2 alternate between green, yellow, and red states, ensuring safe traffic flow at the intersection. The cycle is controlled by a start button.
